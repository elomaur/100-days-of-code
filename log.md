# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 Day 0: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com for a few months now but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C# and .NET. My goal is to complete the courses by the end of the year.

Today, I set up my repo, update the journal log and cleaned up old repos 

**Thoughts:** This is going to be interesting

## R1 Day1: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I practiced loops and conditionals in C#. The challenge was to create a program that prompts the user for
a number, calculates the square of the provided number, and displays the result.

I got to the point where the code is compiling but it is still not displaying the appropriate results. I will work on it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:**  I feel good about this challenge as I did not look for the answer at all. I wanted to make sure I solve it on my own. I used some notes from the lectures.

## R1 Day2: October 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up the code for previous challenge to display the correct output and worked on if/else if/else temperature challenge which was also completed. Found out there is no built in "between" operator in C#. 


**Thoughts:**  So far so good

## R1 Day3: October 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned to validate input using the "continue" statement, "try" code and "catch" exceptions in addition to an intro to variable scope.


**Thoughts:**  While I do understand the concept of exceptions, coding it and reading the errors was challenging. 
The concept of variable scope is still very fuzzy to me. I will need a lot of practice to figure this out.

## R1 Day4: October 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent 9 hours working on Treehouse C# basics courses and completed the entire section while working on various code challenges on input validation, try and catch exception handling and if/else statements.


**Thoughts:**  While I do understand the concept of exceptions, coding it and reading the errors was challenging. 
The concept of variable scope is still very fuzzy to me. I will need a lot of practice to figure this out.

## R1 Day5: October 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Practiced Basic Variables, Input, and Output, Loops and Conditionals in C#

**Thoughts:**  Just a practice day 


## R1 Day6: October 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Object-Oriented Programing in C# and Enums. Practiced programming variables and types. I didn't practice as much as I wanted today partly due to finishing another course about how to learn effectively and some fatigue from sleeping very late the previous night trying to solve a programming problem. Will eat some frogs early tomorrow morning. 

**Thoughts:**  okay day. 



## R1 Day7: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started OOP. Learned how objects and classes, instantiation, private /public fields and object initialization fit into the concept. I had a really hard time grasping instantiation and object initialization despite the practice exercises. I will try again tomorrow and start working on the exercises from the book. Hopefully it will clarify things a little more.

**Thoughts:**  Things are getting harder. 
 

## R1 Day8: October 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed OOP in C# but I need to learn more to deepen my understanding. I did a practice code that helped me further understand what a constructor was.  I will do some reinforcement practice tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Practicing even a little each day helps. 


## R1 Day9: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new practice exercise on instantiating class Instances and  adding constructors. Created classes and added public fields to each class. 

**Thoughts:** It is making more sense one step at a time.  

## R1 Day10: November 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started challenge 2. Added instances for each media type class and added value but I couldn't not get it right. 

**Thoughts:** IMore challenging that I thought

## R1 Day11: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on challenge 2. Still getting errors. 

**Thoughts:** Started working on the exercise from "Learn C# in one day" to get a broader understanding of what I am missing
