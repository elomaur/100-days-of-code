# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 Day 0: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com for a few months now but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C# and .NET. My goal is to complete the courses by the end of the year.

Today, I set up my repo, update the journal log and cleaned up old repos 

**Thoughts:** This is going to be interesting
