# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 Day 0: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com for a few months now but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C# and .NET. My goal is to complete the courses by the end of the year.
Today, I set up gethub and worked on C# for an hour  practicing an exercise in loops and conditionals. You can track my progess here 

**Thoughts:** I spend some time trying to figure out the solution.
