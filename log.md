# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 Day 0: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com for a few months now but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C# and .NET. My goal is to complete the courses by the end of the year.

Today, I set up my repo, update the journal log and cleaned up old repos 

**Thoughts:** This is going to be interesting 


## R1 Day 2: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I practiced loops and conditionals in C#. The challenge was to create a program that prompts the user for
a number, calculates the square of the provided number, and displays the result.

I got to the point where the code is compiling but it is still not displaying the appropriate results. I will work on it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:**  I feel good about this challenge as I did not look for the answer at all. I wanted to make sure I solve it on my own. I used some notes from the lectures.
