# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## R1 Day 0: October 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com for a few months now but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C# and .NET. My goal is to complete the courses by the end of the year.

Today, I set up my repo, update the journal log and cleaned up old repos 

**Thoughts:** This is going to be interesting

## R1 Day 1: October 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I practiced loops and conditionals in C#. The challenge was to create a program that prompts the user for
a number, calculates the square of the provided number, and displays the result.

I got to the point where the code is compiling but it is still not displaying the appropriate results. I will work on it tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:**  I feel good about this challenge as I did not look for the answer at all. I wanted to make sure I solve it on my own. I used some notes from the lectures.

## R1 Day 2: October 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up the code for previous challenge to display the correct output and worked on if/else if/else temperature challenge which was also completed. Found out there is no built in "between" operator in C#. 


**Thoughts:**  So far so good

## R1 Day 3: October 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned to validate input using the "continue" statement, "try" code and "catch" exceptions in addition to an intro to variable scope.


**Thoughts:**  While I do understand the concept of exceptions, coding it and reading the errors was challenging. 
The concept of variable scope is still very fuzzy to me. I will need a lot of practice to figure this out.
