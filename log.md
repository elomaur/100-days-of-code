# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 30, 2018
##### (test) 

**Today's Progress**: I have been taking courses on teamtreehouse.com but I just joined 100 days of code today and will be challenging myself to code every single day for at least an hour while learning C#. 
Today, I set up gethub and worked on C# for an hour  practicing an exercise in loops and conditionals. You can track my progess here 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
